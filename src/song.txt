I'm Just a Baby Dave Days

I know you love me they all do
Hop on the list babe I might pick you
I fell in love girl many times
My heart first broke when I was nine
She cheated on me it really hurt
On the playground with some jerk
I know what love is I've got full experience
But deep down inside

I'm just a baby baby baby Ohhh
A baby baby baby no don't touch me!
Baby baby baby ohhsdfjkldsj
Puberty suck sometimes!

I'm making money everywhere
I've got a room full of underwear
But I don't want you money
And I don't want your clothes
I want a girl who knows
How to maintain a stable relationship
With good communication
Do you take care of kids?
Cause' I've got names picked out
And a drivers license in about (5 months)
I know it all sounds scary
Now baby let's get married
I keep forgetting that I'm

I'm just a baby baby baby Ohhh
A baby baby baby no don't touch me!
Baby baby baby ohhsdfjkldsj
I move away from the microphone to breathe

When I was like 12 I fell in love hard
That's when I knew I couldn't be without girl
Weddings in March
So grab my pack of crayons let's hit the 7th grade
My voice is changing up but I'm still getting
Laid...
...ies home phone numbers so I can call their moms
To talk to my moms to see if we can hang out after
School for a few hours when your moms home from work

WOAH WOAH WOAH! Tay Tay. I saw what you did there
Clever but you can't talk about getting laid
There are kids watching my videos
Dave don't be such a...

Baby baby baby Ohhh
A baby baby baby no don't touch me!
Baby baby baby ohhsdfjkldsj
Puberty suck sometimes!
